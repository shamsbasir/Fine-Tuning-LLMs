# Fine-Tuning-with-RLHF

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks for fine-tuning Natural Language Processing (NLP) models for various tasks. The notebooks use the [Hugging Face Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) library.

## Notebooks

1. **Fine-Tuning FLAN-T5 with RLHF (Reinforcement Learning for Human Feedback)**
   - [Fine_Tuning_FLAN_T5_with_RLHF.ipynb](Fine_Tuning_FLAN_T5_with_RLHF.ipynb)
   - This notebook demonstrates the process of fine-tuning FLAN-T5 for summarizing dialogue using RLHF.

2. **Fine-Tuning LLM (Language Model) with LoRA (Label Refinery)**
   - [Fine_Tuning_LLM_LoRA.ipynb](Fine_Tuning_LLM_LoRA.ipynb)
   - Explore the notebook to understand how to fine-tune a Language Model with LoRA and evaluate its performance.

3. **Summarizing Dialogue with Language Model**
   - [Summarizing_Dialogue_with_LLM.ipynb](Summarizing_Dialogue_with_LLM.ipynb)
   - Learn how to use a Language Model to summarize dialogue content.
